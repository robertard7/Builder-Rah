C:\dev\rah\RahOllamaOnly\Tools\Prompt\sys.uptime.txt
TOOL ID:
sys.uptime

CATEGORY:
system

PURPOSE:
Report how long the container has been up and show load averages.
Also prints the raw /proc/loadavg values.

WHEN TO USE:
- You want to see whether the environment was just restarted.
- You are diagnosing slow builds and need current load averages.
- You want a quick signal of CPU pressure (load) without full process listing.
- You need to confirm /proc is accessible and loadavg is readable.
- You are comparing load before and after starting a task.

WHEN NOT TO USE:
- You need memory usage: use sys.info.
- You need process-level CPU/mem: use sys.ps.
- You need kernel logs: use sys.dmesg.
- You need OS release details: use sys.os.
- You need disk usage: use sys.info.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
- {args} parsing:
  - This tool does not accept arguments.
  - Any provided {args} is ignored by the command template.
- Positional arguments:
  - None.
- Optional arguments:
  - None.
- Defaults:
  - Runs:
    - `uptime`
    - `cat /proc/loadavg`
- Error conditions:
  - uptime missing (rare).
  - /proc/loadavg missing or not readable (abnormal container).
  - cat missing (rare).

EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT:
- Runs inside rah-linux container.
- Working directory behavior:
  - Does not change directory.
- File system assumptions:
  - /proc exists and provides load average data.

OUTPUT:
- stdout behavior:
  - First line: output of `uptime`.
  - Second line: exact contents of `/proc/loadavg`.
- stderr behavior:
  - Failures emit stderr.
- exit codes and meanings:
  - 0: both commands succeeded.
  - Non-zero: one of the commands failed.

SIDE EFFECTS:
- Files created/modified:
  - None.
- Network access:
  - None.
- Installed packages:
  - None.
- State changes:
  - None.

SAFETY RULES:
- MUST verify:
  - Nothing. Read-only.
- MUST NEVER guess:
  - Do not interpret “load average” as CPU usage percent.
  - Do not claim the number of CPU cores unless separately confirmed (sys.info).
- Requires user confirmation:
  - None.

COMMON FAILURE MODES:
- Some container environments may show host load averages, not container-only.
- Load averages can be high during compile bursts; that is not automatically an error.
- uptime output format varies across distros.

EXAMPLES:
1) sys.uptime
2) sys.uptime 
3) sys.uptime ignored
4) sys.uptime anything
5) sys.uptime check_load

ANTI-HALLUCINATION NOTES:
- Do NOT invent uptime duration or load values.
- Do NOT assume a load of “1.00” means healthy; core count matters and must be verified separately.
- Do NOT claim container restart time unless uptime shows it clearly.
- Do NOT infer memory pressure from loadavg.
- Keep the output as authoritative text; quote exact values when needed.
- If /proc/loadavg is unreadable, do not guess; report failure.
- Do not confuse “load average” with “system load” marketing language.
- Do not interpret the last fields of /proc/loadavg unless you know them; if explaining, keep it minimal and factual.
- This tool is a snapshot; do not claim trend without repeated calls.
- Never pretend it can reset or change load.
- If user asks for “CPU usage”, route to sys.ps and sys.info.
- If user asks for “why load is high”, do not guess; request further diagnostics.
- Do not fabricate timestamps.
- Do not claim the host OS uptime; this is container context.
- Keep comparisons grounded in actual printed outputs only.
