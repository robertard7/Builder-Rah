TOOL ID:
windows.file.searchpath
CATEGORY:
grep
PURPOSE:
Search for a literal (simple match) string within a single specified file and print matching line numbers and lines.
WHEN TO USE:
- You need to find occurrences of a literal substring in one file quickly.
- You want line numbers for matches to patch or review code.
- You need a safe, file-scoped search rather than scanning the whole repo.
WHEN NOT TO USE:
- You need to search across many files (use windows.grep.text or windows.grep.files).
- You need regex matching (this tool uses -SimpleMatch literal search).
- You need to search directories by filename pattern (use windows.file.find).
INPUT PARAMETERS:
- args: <path> <pattern>
  - Parsed by locating the first space in the raw args string:
    $raw = '{args}'
    $i = $raw.IndexOf(' ')
    if($i -lt 1) { throw 'usage: <path> <pattern>' }
    $p = $raw.Substring(0,$i).Trim()
    $pat = $raw.Substring($i+1)
  - Everything after the first space is the pattern (can include spaces).
  - The path portion cannot include spaces (because it is cut at first space).
  - The file must exist: if(!(Test-Path -LiteralPath $p)) { throw 'not a file' }
EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT:
- Windows host.
- Runs:
  powershell -NoProfile -Command "<script>"
- ErrorActionPreference 'Stop'.
- Uses:
  Select-String -LiteralPath $p -SimpleMatch -Pattern $pat
  | Select-Object LineNumber,Line
  | Format-Table -Auto
OUTPUT:
- A table of matches with columns:
  LineNumber
  Line
- Only matching lines are printed.
SIDE EFFECTS:
- None (read-only).
SAFETY RULES:
- This tool prints lines from the file; treat secrets as sensitive.
- Since it is literal search, do not claim regex behavior (no wildcards, no character classes).
- If you need to search a file path with spaces, this tool cannot accept it as written.
COMMON FAILURE MODES:
- Missing space separator in args -> throws usage error.
- File path contains spaces -> will be truncated and likely fail Test-Path.
- File not found -> throws 'not a file'.
- Very large files: search may be slow.
EXAMPLES:
- Search a C# file for a symbol:
  [[TOOL:RUN]]
  id=windows.file.searchpath
  args=.\Workflow\WorkflowFacade.cs PlanAsync
  [[/TOOL]]

- Search a JSON for a key:
  [[TOOL:RUN]]
  id=windows.file.searchpath
  args=.\appsettings.json Ollama
  [[/TOOL]]

- Search for a phrase with spaces:
  [[TOOL:RUN]]
  id=windows.file.searchpath
  args=.\README.md "Tool manifest"
  [[/TOOL]]
  Note: quotes are part of the pattern string if included; it still does literal matching.

ANTI-HALLUCINATION NOTES:
- Path is everything before the first space. If your path contains spaces, this tool cannot represent it.
- Pattern is literal due to -SimpleMatch. Do not pretend it supports regex.
- Output is only matching lines; “no output” means no matches or the command failed.
- The tool throws on missing file; it does not silently return empty results.
- Do not infer file encoding; PowerShell chooses decoding behavior.

DETAILED WINDOWS EXECUTION NOTES:
- This prompt is bound to the windows.tools.json manifest entry and must not be regenerated.
- Always prefer the existing file over creating a new one; only write a new prompt if the manifest is missing it.
- Keep the tool id exact and prefixed with 'windows.' to avoid collisions with linux prompts.
- Run commands from a Windows host with PowerShell available; the manifest templates already include -NoProfile.
- Expect commands to run without interactivity; do not add prompts or confirmations beyond what the tool already emits.
- Respect the working directory assumptions in the manifest command and avoid altering paths unless the user requested it.
- Avoid adding new parameters; pass the raw args string exactly into the manifest template.
- Preserve UTF-8 text handling and keep outputs readable for log capture and trace review.

WHEN TO USE (DETAILED):
- Call this tool when the manifest describes the exact action needed; do not substitute other tools with similar names.
- Prefer the Windows variant over any linux.* or unprefixed variant when the manifest id starts with windows.
- Use this file as the authoritative behavior description before attempting to modify any commands.
- Reuse the existing prompt structure to keep behavior stable across runs and deployments.

WHEN NOT TO USE (DETAILED):
- Do not invoke if the requested outcome mismatches the manifest command semantics.
- Avoid using this tool to guess system state; rely on the command output only.
- Do not call if credentials, secrets, or sensitive tokens would be echoed back in clear text.
- Skip this tool if the user asked for a Linux/WSL-only action; choose the linux prompt instead when appropriate.

INPUT HANDLING DETAILS:
- Provide arguments exactly as they should be placed into {args} with minimal quoting changes.
- Trim trailing spaces and avoid smart quotes or unusual whitespace that PowerShell may misinterpret.
- Validate optional numeric parameters before using them; default values in the manifest should remain intact.
- If the tool ignores args, state that clearly and do not invent new switches.
- Ensure paths use Windows separators or are PowerShell-friendly (e.g., ./relative/path).
- Do not insert environment variables or aliases that are not already part of the manifest template.

OUTPUT EXPECTATIONS:
- Expect plain text output suitable for logs and downstream parsing.
- Capture both stdout and stderr when summarizing results; note if stderr is expected to be empty.
- Preserve table formatting and line ordering; do not truncate unless the manifest already limits rows.
- If the command emits warnings by design, mention them but do not treat them as failures unless exit code is non-zero.
- Avoid reformatting the output in the prompt; let the command speak for itself.

SIDE EFFECTS AND STATE:
- Most tools are read-only; confirm before suggesting that files or directories will change.
- If the tool touches the filesystem (creates temp files or directories), state that it cleans up after itself.
- Do not claim that the tool installs packages or modifies config unless the manifest command actually does.
- Note whether network access is required and whether proxies/firewalls could affect results.

SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST:
1) Confirm the tool id exactly matches the manifest (no silent renames).
2) Verify the filename is <toolId>.txt and lives under Tools/Prompt/.
3) Ensure the TOOL ID line inside the file matches the filename and manifest id.
4) Do not drop the windows. prefix; it is required for Windows tool separation.
5) Scan existing prompt files before generating new content to avoid duplicates.
6) Keep instructions platform-accurate (Windows commands stay Windows).
7) Avoid adding sudo/bash guidance here; stay within PowerShell semantics.
8) Mention prerequisites such as winget, git, dotnet, or compilers if the manifest depends on them.
9) Encourage dry runs or read-only checks before destructive actions if applicable.
10) Remind the operator to review path arguments to avoid deleting unintended directories.

FAILURE MODES AND TRIAGE NOTES:
- Non-zero exit codes should be surfaced plainly; do not claim success on partial output.
- Missing command dependencies (git/winget/dotnet/cmake) should be reported as blocking issues.
- Network-dependent commands may fail with timeouts or TLS errors; report them without rewriting history.
- Permission denied errors may require elevation; do not assume elevation is available.
- If the tool relies on a temp file, mention where it is created and that it is deleted afterward.
- If the command uses relative paths, ensure the caller understands they are relative to the working directory.

EXAMPLE CALLS (ADAPT AS NEEDED):
- Example 1: Invoke windows.file.searchpath with minimal args to exercise the manifest template end-to-end.
- Example 2: Capture verbose output by adding logging flags only if the manifest allows optional args.
- Example 3: Pair windows.file.searchpath with a follow-up inspection tool (e.g., windows.git.status) instead of modifying the template.
- Example 4: Demonstrate failure handling by noting what happens when required args are missing or malformed.

ANTI-HALLUCINATION GUARDRAILS:
- Do not fabricate new commands, flags, or behavior; stick strictly to the manifest cmd string.
- Do not invent files, directories, or outputs that are not produced by the tool.
- Do not promise success for actions that depend on external services or privileges.
- Be explicit when the tool ignores args or when args are optional.
- Call out any ambiguity and request clarification rather than guessing the desired command.
- Keep the description focused on how to run windows.file.searchpath safely rather than solving unrelated tasks.

AUDIT TRAIL REMINDERS:
- Note that each prompt should remain between 100 and 300 lines after expansion for consistency.
- Retain clear section headers so future maintainers can verify coverage quickly.
- Keep examples and safety notes updated if the manifest command changes in the future.
- Document whether the tool is read-only or mutates state so reviewers can gauge blast radius.
- Encourage attaching actual command output in logs when validating fixes.

POST-RUN FOLLOW-UPS:
- Summarize key results briefly while linking back to the command output lines.
- Suggest next-step tools (e.g., windows.git.diff after windows.git.status) without altering this tool's command.
- If the run failed, propose concrete remediation steps such as installing prerequisites or re-running with adjusted args.
- Remind that reruns should continue using the same manifest-defined id and filename.

PERSISTENCE OF RULES:
- The no-regeneration rule is permanent: reuse these files unless a manifest tool is truly missing.
- Never drop or shorten the windows.* prefix; it distinguishes Windows tools from Linux ones.
- Keep TOOL ID, CATEGORY, and PURPOSE sections unchanged except for correctness fixes.
- Any expansions must preserve the underlying command template semantics exactly.
- Do not let LLM auto-completion invent different ids or filenames while editing these prompts.
- When in doubt, read the manifest first, then the existing prompt, and only then make edits.
