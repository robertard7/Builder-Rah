C:\dev\rah\RahOllamaOnly\Tools\Prompt\apt.install.languages.txt
TOOL ID:
apt.install.languages

CATEGORY:
build

PURPOSE:
Install a broad language toolchain inside the rah-linux container.
Installs: gcc g++ clang make cmake ninja-build git curl wget python3 python3-venv python3-pip nodejs npm openjdk-17-jdk maven gradle golang-go rustc cargo php-cli phpunit ruby-full.

WHEN TO USE:
- You need a “kitchen sink” dev container to build and test multiple languages.
- You are running cross-language components and want all major toolchains available.
- You plan to build projects that could be C/C++/Rust/Go/Node/Java/Python/PHP/Ruby.
- Tools like cargo, go, npm, mvn are missing and you want them installed quickly.

WHEN NOT TO USE:
- You want minimal container footprint; this installs many packages.
- You only need a small subset: use apt.install or apt.install.core.
- Network access is not allowed.
- Disk space is limited.
- You are on the Windows host; this changes only the container.
- You need specific versions pinned; this uses apt repo defaults.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
- {args} parsing:
  - This tool does not accept arguments.
  - Any provided {args} is ignored.
- Positional arguments:
  - None.
- Optional arguments:
  - None.
- Defaults:
  - Always runs apt-get update and installs the fixed package list above.
- Error conditions:
  - apt update/install failures.
  - dpkg lock.
  - disk full (more likely due to size).
  - repo signature issues.
  - package conflicts or unavailable packages.

EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT:
- Runs inside rah-linux container.
- Working directory behavior:
  - Does not change directory.
- File system assumptions:
  - apt-get available and configured.
  - Sufficient disk space for many toolchains.

OUTPUT:
- stdout behavior:
  - apt-get update output then install progress for many packages.
- stderr behavior:
  - apt/dpkg errors.
- exit codes and meanings:
  - 0: installation succeeded.
  - Non-zero: failure.

SIDE EFFECTS:
- Files created/modified:
  - Installs many packages and dependencies into container.
  - Updates apt lists and dpkg database.
- Network access:
  - Yes.
- Installed packages:
  - Yes, fixed list plus dependencies.
- State changes:
  - Adds many executables: gcc, g++, clang, python3, pip, node, npm, java, mvn, gradle, go, rustc, cargo, php, phpunit, ruby, etc.

SAFETY RULES:
- MUST verify:
  - User explicitly wants broad toolchain installed (size/impact).
  - Network access is allowed.
  - Disk constraints are acceptable.
- MUST NEVER guess:
  - Never claim “only a few packages”; this is large.
  - Never add extra packages; list is fixed.
  - Never claim specific versions; apt decides.
- Requires user confirmation:
  - Strongly required if user did not explicitly request this broad install.

COMMON FAILURE MODES:
- Disk full during install.
- apt update network failures.
- Package conflicts.
- Repo signature errors.
- Slow mirrors/timeouts.
- dpkg lock.

EXAMPLES:
1) apt.install.languages
2) apt.install.languages toolchain
3) apt.install.languages now
4) apt.install.languages ignored-args
5) apt.install.languages bootstrap

ANTI-HALLUCINATION NOTES:
- Do NOT claim every language build will succeed after this; toolchains may still need project-specific deps.
- Do NOT claim host system changed; container-only.
- Do NOT claim exact language versions; verify using each tool’s version command separately if needed.
- Do NOT infer that node uses a modern version; apt repo versions vary by distro.
- Do NOT assume gradle or maven settings; only installs binaries.
- Do NOT claim python venvs are created; only packages installed.
- Do NOT hide apt errors; they are essential.
- Do NOT re-run repeatedly; diagnose failure from output.
- Do NOT add flags; tool is fixed.
- Treat installed package list as authoritative.
- If user wants minimal, do not recommend this tool; it is intentionally broad.
- Do NOT claim security posture improvements; more packages increases surface area.
- Keep conclusions conservative and tied to apt output.
- Do NOT reference other tools not in scope here.
- Do NOT assume npm will work behind proxies; that is environment-specific.
- Validate availability with sys.which after install; do not assume.
