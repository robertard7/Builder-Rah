C:\dev\rah\RahOllamaOnly\Tools\Prompt\windows.sys.info.txt
TOOL ID:
windows.sys.info
CATEGORY:
sys
PURPOSE:
Collect high-level Windows host system information in a single shot: OS version/build, CPU details, RAM totals, and volume/drive stats.
WHEN TO USE:
- You need a quick baseline of the Windows machine running RahOllamaOnly.
- You suspect environment issues (wrong Windows version, low RAM, disk full).
- You are about to run builds or installs and want to confirm CPU/RAM/storage.
- You need to capture “what machine is this” for a trace/log or bug report.
WHEN NOT TO USE:
- You need detailed per-process CPU/memory (use windows.sys.ps).
- You need uptime only (use windows.sys.uptime).
- You need environment variables (use windows.sys.env).
- You need event log tail (use windows.sys.dmesg).
INPUT PARAMETERS:
- None.
- Any provided args are ignored because the manifest command does not reference {args}.
EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT:
- Windows host.
- Executes via:
  powershell -NoProfile -Command "<script>"
- PowerShell ErrorActionPreference is set to 'Stop' inside the command.
- Requires built-in PowerShell cmdlets and WMI/CIM providers:
  - Get-ComputerInfo
  - Get-CimInstance
  - Get-Volume
OUTPUT:
- Printed text to stdout, formatted by Format-List and Format-Table.
- Sections are concatenated in this order:
  1) Get-ComputerInfo selected OS fields (Format-List)
  2) Win32_Processor fields (Format-Table -Auto)
  3) Win32_OperatingSystem memory fields (Format-List)
  4) Get-Volume fields (Format-Table -Auto)
SIDE EFFECTS:
- None expected (read-only queries).
- May be slower on systems with delayed CIM responses.
SAFETY RULES:
- Do not assume this command reveals secrets; it can include machine name (CsName).
- Do not attempt to “fix” or “enhance” output; this tool is read-only.
- Do not run repeatedly in tight loops; CIM queries can be slow.
- Do not claim it returns GPU information; it does not.
COMMON FAILURE MODES:
- Get-ComputerInfo not available or restricted (older PowerShell/Windows editions).
- Get-Volume fails if storage cmdlets are unavailable or require elevation in some environments.
- CIM/WMI provider issues:
  - Win32_Processor query fails
  - Win32_OperatingSystem query fails
- PowerShell execution policy/environment blocks powershell invocation.
- Output formatting truncation due to console width (Format-Table behavior).
EXAMPLES:
- Minimal (typical):
  [[TOOL:RUN]]
  id=windows.sys.info
  [[/TOOL]]

- Capture system baseline before diagnosing a build:
  1) Run windows.sys.info
  2) Run windows.sys.which dotnet git cmake ninja
  3) Run windows.dotnet.info

- Confirm disk space before large clone/build:
  [[TOOL:RUN]]
  id=windows.sys.info
  [[/TOOL]]
  (Check Get-Volume SizeRemaining / Size columns.)

ANTI-HALLUCINATION NOTES:
- This tool does NOT accept args; any args you pass are ignored.
- This tool does NOT:
  - list installed programs
  - show network configuration
  - show GPU details
  - show Docker status
- Output is formatted; tables may wrap and truncate visually, but that is formatting, not missing data.
- If any section is missing, assume the underlying cmdlet failed and treat it as an error, not “the machine has no CPU.”
- “TotalVisibleMemorySize” and “FreePhysicalMemory” are the ONLY memory fields emitted; do not invent other numbers.
- Get-Volume reports volumes with DriveLetter; volumes without a drive letter may not show as you expect.
- Always treat CsName as the computer name; do not guess domain/workgroup membership from it.

DETAILED WINDOWS EXECUTION NOTES:
- This prompt is bound to the windows.tools.json manifest entry and must not be regenerated.
- Always prefer the existing file over creating a new one; only write a new prompt if the manifest is missing it.
- Keep the tool id exact and prefixed with 'windows.' to avoid collisions with linux prompts.
- Run commands from a Windows host with PowerShell available; the manifest templates already include -NoProfile.
- Expect commands to run without interactivity; do not add prompts or confirmations beyond what the tool already emits.
- Respect the working directory assumptions in the manifest command and avoid altering paths unless the user requested it.
- Avoid adding new parameters; pass the raw args string exactly into the manifest template.
- Preserve UTF-8 text handling and keep outputs readable for log capture and trace review.

WHEN TO USE (DETAILED):
- Call this tool when the manifest describes the exact action needed; do not substitute other tools with similar names.
- Prefer the Windows variant over any linux.* or unprefixed variant when the manifest id starts with windows.
- Use this file as the authoritative behavior description before attempting to modify any commands.
- Reuse the existing prompt structure to keep behavior stable across runs and deployments.

WHEN NOT TO USE (DETAILED):
- Do not invoke if the requested outcome mismatches the manifest command semantics.
- Avoid using this tool to guess system state; rely on the command output only.
- Do not call if credentials, secrets, or sensitive tokens would be echoed back in clear text.
- Skip this tool if the user asked for a Linux/WSL-only action; choose the linux prompt instead when appropriate.

INPUT HANDLING DETAILS:
- Provide arguments exactly as they should be placed into {args} with minimal quoting changes.
- Trim trailing spaces and avoid smart quotes or unusual whitespace that PowerShell may misinterpret.
- Validate optional numeric parameters before using them; default values in the manifest should remain intact.
- If the tool ignores args, state that clearly and do not invent new switches.
- Ensure paths use Windows separators or are PowerShell-friendly (e.g., ./relative/path).
- Do not insert environment variables or aliases that are not already part of the manifest template.

OUTPUT EXPECTATIONS:
- Expect plain text output suitable for logs and downstream parsing.
- Capture both stdout and stderr when summarizing results; note if stderr is expected to be empty.
- Preserve table formatting and line ordering; do not truncate unless the manifest already limits rows.
- If the command emits warnings by design, mention them but do not treat them as failures unless exit code is non-zero.
- Avoid reformatting the output in the prompt; let the command speak for itself.

SIDE EFFECTS AND STATE:
- Most tools are read-only; confirm before suggesting that files or directories will change.
- If the tool touches the filesystem (creates temp files or directories), state that it cleans up after itself.
- Do not claim that the tool installs packages or modifies config unless the manifest command actually does.
- Note whether network access is required and whether proxies/firewalls could affect results.

SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST:
1) Confirm the tool id exactly matches the manifest (no silent renames).
2) Verify the filename is <toolId>.txt and lives under Tools/Prompt/.
3) Ensure the TOOL ID line inside the file matches the filename and manifest id.
4) Do not drop the windows. prefix; it is required for Windows tool separation.
5) Scan existing prompt files before generating new content to avoid duplicates.
6) Keep instructions platform-accurate (Windows commands stay Windows).
7) Avoid adding sudo/bash guidance here; stay within PowerShell semantics.
8) Mention prerequisites such as winget, git, dotnet, or compilers if the manifest depends on them.
9) Encourage dry runs or read-only checks before destructive actions if applicable.
10) Remind the operator to review path arguments to avoid deleting unintended directories.

FAILURE MODES AND TRIAGE NOTES:
- Non-zero exit codes should be surfaced plainly; do not claim success on partial output.
- Missing command dependencies (git/winget/dotnet/cmake) should be reported as blocking issues.
- Network-dependent commands may fail with timeouts or TLS errors; report them without rewriting history.
- Permission denied errors may require elevation; do not assume elevation is available.
- If the tool relies on a temp file, mention where it is created and that it is deleted afterward.
- If the command uses relative paths, ensure the caller understands they are relative to the working directory.

EXAMPLE CALLS (ADAPT AS NEEDED):
- Example 1: Invoke windows.sys.info with minimal args to exercise the manifest template end-to-end.
- Example 2: Capture verbose output by adding logging flags only if the manifest allows optional args.
- Example 3: Pair windows.sys.info with a follow-up inspection tool (e.g., windows.git.status) instead of modifying the template.
- Example 4: Demonstrate failure handling by noting what happens when required args are missing or malformed.

ANTI-HALLUCINATION GUARDRAILS:
- Do not fabricate new commands, flags, or behavior; stick strictly to the manifest cmd string.
- Do not invent files, directories, or outputs that are not produced by the tool.
- Do not promise success for actions that depend on external services or privileges.
- Be explicit when the tool ignores args or when args are optional.
- Call out any ambiguity and request clarification rather than guessing the desired command.
- Keep the description focused on how to run windows.sys.info safely rather than solving unrelated tasks.

AUDIT TRAIL REMINDERS:
- Note that each prompt should remain between 100 and 300 lines after expansion for consistency.
- Retain clear section headers so future maintainers can verify coverage quickly.
- Keep examples and safety notes updated if the manifest command changes in the future.
- Document whether the tool is read-only or mutates state so reviewers can gauge blast radius.
- Encourage attaching actual command output in logs when validating fixes.

POST-RUN FOLLOW-UPS:
- Summarize key results briefly while linking back to the command output lines.
- Suggest next-step tools (e.g., windows.git.diff after windows.git.status) without altering this tool's command.
- If the run failed, propose concrete remediation steps such as installing prerequisites or re-running with adjusted args.
- Remind that reruns should continue using the same manifest-defined id and filename.

PERSISTENCE OF RULES:
- The no-regeneration rule is permanent: reuse these files unless a manifest tool is truly missing.
- Never drop or shorten the windows.* prefix; it distinguishes Windows tools from Linux ones.
- Keep TOOL ID, CATEGORY, and PURPOSE sections unchanged except for correctness fixes.
- Any expansions must preserve the underlying command template semantics exactly.
- Do not let LLM auto-completion invent different ids or filenames while editing these prompts.
- When in doubt, read the manifest first, then the existing prompt, and only then make edits.
