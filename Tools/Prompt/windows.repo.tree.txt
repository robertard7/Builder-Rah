C:\dev\rah\RahOllamaOnly\Tools\Prompt\windows.repo.tree.txt
TOOL ID:
windows.repo.tree
CATEGORY:
repo
PURPOSE:
Provide a directory tree view of a target path. If the Windows 'tree' command exists, it uses cmd /c tree "<path>" /F /A; otherwise it falls back to a recursive directory listing (directories only) up to depth 3.
WHEN TO USE:
- You need a quick structural view of a repo or folder.
- You want to see both folders and files (when 'tree' command is available).
- You’re orienting the AI/executor to where projects and files live.
WHEN NOT TO USE:
- You need to list only directories with a numeric depth control from current dir (use windows.repo.finddir).
- You need to find a specific file by name pattern (use windows.file.find).
- You need content search (use windows.grep.*).
INPUT PARAMETERS:
- args: <path optional>
  - Entire raw args assigned: $p = '{args}'
  - If args is null/empty/whitespace, defaults to '.'
  - Not tokenized; if you pass multiple tokens, they become part of $p and may fail.
EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT:
- Windows host.
- Runs:
  powershell -NoProfile -Command "<script>"
- ErrorActionPreference 'Stop'.
- Behavior:
  - If (Get-Command tree) succeeds:
    - Executes: cmd /c "tree \"$p\" /F /A"
      - /F includes files
      - /A uses ASCII
  - Else:
    - Runs: Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Directory -Depth 3 -Force -Path $p
      - Takes first 400 and prints FullName
OUTPUT:
- If tree exists:
  - Outputs the raw text tree from cmd.exe
- If tree does not exist:
  - Outputs up to 400 directory FullName strings.
SIDE EFFECTS:
- None (read-only).
SAFETY RULES:
- Beware of huge directories: 'tree' can output a lot. This tool does not cap tree output when tree exists.
- Do not claim the fallback lists files; fallback lists directories only.
- Do not assume output order is stable across file systems.
COMMON FAILURE MODES:
- Invalid path or access denied.
- If args contains quotes/spaces, cmd quoting may behave unexpectedly.
- PowerShell depth recursion requires PowerShell version supporting -Depth (PowerShell 7+ supports Depth for Get-ChildItem; Windows PowerShell support depends on version).
- In fallback mode, -Depth may not be supported in some environments, causing error.
EXAMPLES:
- Default current directory:
  [[TOOL:RUN]]
  id=windows.repo.tree
  [[/TOOL]]

- Specific path:
  [[TOOL:RUN]]
  id=windows.repo.tree
  args=C:\dev\rah\RahOllamaOnly
  [[/TOOL]]

- If tree isn’t available:
  Expect a list of directory paths only, not files.

ANTI-HALLUCINATION NOTES:
- args is not split; it’s a single path string.
- This tool may run cmd.exe 'tree' which is not PowerShell output. Do not treat it as objects.
- If tree exists, output is unbounded by this tool; do not promise “max 400 lines.”
- If tree does not exist, fallback caps to 400 directories and depth 3.
- Do not invent file listings in fallback mode.

DETAILED WINDOWS EXECUTION NOTES:
- This prompt is bound to the windows.tools.json manifest entry and must not be regenerated.
- Always prefer the existing file over creating a new one; only write a new prompt if the manifest is missing it.
- Keep the tool id exact and prefixed with 'windows.' to avoid collisions with linux prompts.
- Run commands from a Windows host with PowerShell available; the manifest templates already include -NoProfile.
- Expect commands to run without interactivity; do not add prompts or confirmations beyond what the tool already emits.
- Respect the working directory assumptions in the manifest command and avoid altering paths unless the user requested it.
- Avoid adding new parameters; pass the raw args string exactly into the manifest template.
- Preserve UTF-8 text handling and keep outputs readable for log capture and trace review.

WHEN TO USE (DETAILED):
- Call this tool when the manifest describes the exact action needed; do not substitute other tools with similar names.
- Prefer the Windows variant over any linux.* or unprefixed variant when the manifest id starts with windows.
- Use this file as the authoritative behavior description before attempting to modify any commands.
- Reuse the existing prompt structure to keep behavior stable across runs and deployments.

WHEN NOT TO USE (DETAILED):
- Do not invoke if the requested outcome mismatches the manifest command semantics.
- Avoid using this tool to guess system state; rely on the command output only.
- Do not call if credentials, secrets, or sensitive tokens would be echoed back in clear text.
- Skip this tool if the user asked for a Linux/WSL-only action; choose the linux prompt instead when appropriate.

INPUT HANDLING DETAILS:
- Provide arguments exactly as they should be placed into {args} with minimal quoting changes.
- Trim trailing spaces and avoid smart quotes or unusual whitespace that PowerShell may misinterpret.
- Validate optional numeric parameters before using them; default values in the manifest should remain intact.
- If the tool ignores args, state that clearly and do not invent new switches.
- Ensure paths use Windows separators or are PowerShell-friendly (e.g., ./relative/path).
- Do not insert environment variables or aliases that are not already part of the manifest template.

OUTPUT EXPECTATIONS:
- Expect plain text output suitable for logs and downstream parsing.
- Capture both stdout and stderr when summarizing results; note if stderr is expected to be empty.
- Preserve table formatting and line ordering; do not truncate unless the manifest already limits rows.
- If the command emits warnings by design, mention them but do not treat them as failures unless exit code is non-zero.
- Avoid reformatting the output in the prompt; let the command speak for itself.

SIDE EFFECTS AND STATE:
- Most tools are read-only; confirm before suggesting that files or directories will change.
- If the tool touches the filesystem (creates temp files or directories), state that it cleans up after itself.
- Do not claim that the tool installs packages or modifies config unless the manifest command actually does.
- Note whether network access is required and whether proxies/firewalls could affect results.

SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST:
1) Confirm the tool id exactly matches the manifest (no silent renames).
2) Verify the filename is <toolId>.txt and lives under Tools/Prompt/.
3) Ensure the TOOL ID line inside the file matches the filename and manifest id.
4) Do not drop the windows. prefix; it is required for Windows tool separation.
5) Scan existing prompt files before generating new content to avoid duplicates.
6) Keep instructions platform-accurate (Windows commands stay Windows).
7) Avoid adding sudo/bash guidance here; stay within PowerShell semantics.
8) Mention prerequisites such as winget, git, dotnet, or compilers if the manifest depends on them.
9) Encourage dry runs or read-only checks before destructive actions if applicable.
10) Remind the operator to review path arguments to avoid deleting unintended directories.

FAILURE MODES AND TRIAGE NOTES:
- Non-zero exit codes should be surfaced plainly; do not claim success on partial output.
- Missing command dependencies (git/winget/dotnet/cmake) should be reported as blocking issues.
- Network-dependent commands may fail with timeouts or TLS errors; report them without rewriting history.
- Permission denied errors may require elevation; do not assume elevation is available.
- If the tool relies on a temp file, mention where it is created and that it is deleted afterward.
- If the command uses relative paths, ensure the caller understands they are relative to the working directory.

EXAMPLE CALLS (ADAPT AS NEEDED):
- Example 1: Invoke windows.repo.tree with minimal args to exercise the manifest template end-to-end.
- Example 2: Capture verbose output by adding logging flags only if the manifest allows optional args.
- Example 3: Pair windows.repo.tree with a follow-up inspection tool (e.g., windows.git.status) instead of modifying the template.
- Example 4: Demonstrate failure handling by noting what happens when required args are missing or malformed.

ANTI-HALLUCINATION GUARDRAILS:
- Do not fabricate new commands, flags, or behavior; stick strictly to the manifest cmd string.
- Do not invent files, directories, or outputs that are not produced by the tool.
- Do not promise success for actions that depend on external services or privileges.
- Be explicit when the tool ignores args or when args are optional.
- Call out any ambiguity and request clarification rather than guessing the desired command.
- Keep the description focused on how to run windows.repo.tree safely rather than solving unrelated tasks.

AUDIT TRAIL REMINDERS:
- Note that each prompt should remain between 100 and 300 lines after expansion for consistency.
- Retain clear section headers so future maintainers can verify coverage quickly.
- Keep examples and safety notes updated if the manifest command changes in the future.
- Document whether the tool is read-only or mutates state so reviewers can gauge blast radius.
- Encourage attaching actual command output in logs when validating fixes.

POST-RUN FOLLOW-UPS:
- Summarize key results briefly while linking back to the command output lines.
- Suggest next-step tools (e.g., windows.git.diff after windows.git.status) without altering this tool's command.
- If the run failed, propose concrete remediation steps such as installing prerequisites or re-running with adjusted args.
- Remind that reruns should continue using the same manifest-defined id and filename.

PERSISTENCE OF RULES:
- The no-regeneration rule is permanent: reuse these files unless a manifest tool is truly missing.
- Never drop or shorten the windows.* prefix; it distinguishes Windows tools from Linux ones.
- Keep TOOL ID, CATEGORY, and PURPOSE sections unchanged except for correctness fixes.
- Any expansions must preserve the underlying command template semantics exactly.
- Do not let LLM auto-completion invent different ids or filenames while editing these prompts.
- When in doubt, read the manifest first, then the existing prompt, and only then make edits.
