TOOL ID:
dotnet.info

CATEGORY:
build

PURPOSE:
Print dotnet SDK and runtime information by running `dotnet --info`.
Used to verify dotnet availability and diagnose environment issues.

WHEN TO USE:
- You need to confirm whether dotnet is installed and accessible in PATH.
- You need to see installed SDK versions and runtimes.
- You need to diagnose dotnet runtime dependency errors in the container.
- You want environment details like RID, base path, OS version as dotnet sees it.
- You are verifying the container can run dotnet builds.

WHEN NOT TO USE:
- dotnet is known to be missing and you are ready to install prereqs: use apt tools first.
- You need to build a project: use build.dotnet.
- You need to run tests: use test.dotnet.
- You want Windows host dotnet info: this runs inside container only.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
- {args} parsing:
  - This tool does not accept arguments.
  - Any provided {args} is ignored.
- Positional arguments:
  - None.
- Optional arguments:
  - None.
- Defaults:
  - Runs `dotnet --info`.
- Error conditions:
  - If dotnet not installed or not in PATH: command fails non-zero.
  - If required system libraries missing: dotnet may print an error and exit non-zero.
  - If permissions prevent access to dotnet install directories: failure.

EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT:
- Runs inside rah-linux container.
- Working directory behavior:
  - Does not change directory.
- File system assumptions:
  - dotnet binary is present somewhere on PATH for success.

OUTPUT:
- stdout behavior:
  - dotnet --info output including SDKs, runtimes, environment.
- stderr behavior:
  - dotnet errors, missing library messages, hostfxr issues.
- exit codes and meanings:
  - 0: dotnet --info succeeded.
  - Non-zero: dotnet missing or runtime failure.

SIDE EFFECTS:
- Files created/modified:
  - None.
- Network access:
  - None.
- Installed packages:
  - None.
- State changes:
  - None.

SAFETY RULES:
- MUST verify:
  - None; this is read-only.
- MUST NEVER guess:
  - Never claim a specific SDK version is installed without output.
  - Never claim dotnet is present if command fails.
- Requires user confirmation:
  - None.

COMMON FAILURE MODES:
- dotnet not found in PATH.
- libicu or zlib missing causing host failure.
- Running in a minimal container without required runtime deps.
- Misconfigured DOTNET_ROOT or PATH.
- Permission issues.

EXAMPLES:
1) dotnet.info
2) dotnet.info now
3) dotnet.info ignored
4) dotnet.info check
5) dotnet.info status

ANTI-HALLUCINATION NOTES:
- Do NOT summarize versions unless they are printed.
- Do NOT infer that dotnet can build WinForms in Linux; the tool only reports environment.
- Do NOT claim workloads are installed; dotnet --info lists what exists.
- Do NOT claim a preview vs stable status unless output indicates.
- Do NOT claim path locations beyond what dotnet prints.
- If dotnet fails, use the exact error text; do not guess missing libraries.
- Do NOT treat partial output as success; check exit code if available.
- Do NOT claim host machine dotnet is affected; container-only.
- Do NOT advise installing random libraries; base on error output and available apt tools.
- Keep conclusions conservative: dotnet.info success means dotnet runs, not that builds succeed.
- Do NOT add flags; tool is fixed.
- Treat output as authoritative snapshot.
- Do NOT reference tools not yet written.
- If user requests install guidance, require explicit package list or use apt.install.dotnet prereqs with approval.
- Never invent RID or OS details; quote from output only.
