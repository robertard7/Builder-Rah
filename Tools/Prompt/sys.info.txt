TOOL ID:
sys.info

CATEGORY:
system

PURPOSE:
Collect a quick snapshot of the runtime system state inside the rah-linux container.
It prints kernel info, CPU details, memory usage, disk usage, and current mounts.
This tool is read-only and is used to understand the environment before debugging or running builds.

WHEN TO USE:
- You need to confirm what kernel and architecture the container is running.
- You need CPU model, core counts, and flags to reason about build or runtime compatibility.
- You need to see RAM totals and current memory pressure before heavy tasks.
- You need to confirm what disks are visible and how full /work is before cloning/building.
- You need to confirm mounts exist and what is mounted where (e.g., /work, /rah/tools).
- You are triaging “works on my machine” differences between host and container.
- You are investigating unexpected slowness and want load-bearing basics first.

WHEN NOT TO USE:
- You need detailed per-process analysis: use sys.ps instead.
- You need OS distribution metadata: use sys.os instead.
- You need to confirm a specific binary exists in PATH: use sys.which instead.
- You need to confirm mount writability: use sys.mount.check instead.
- You need network diagnostics: use net.* tools instead.
- You need kernel ring buffer logs: use sys.dmesg instead.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
- {args} parsing:
  - This tool does not accept arguments.
  - Any provided {args} is ignored by the underlying command template.
- Positional arguments:
  - None.
- Optional arguments:
  - None.
- Defaults:
  - Always runs the same fixed set of commands.
- Error conditions:
  - If a subcommand is missing (unlikely), output may be incomplete.
  - If permissions restrict a subcommand, that subcommand may fail and stop output if the shell pipeline halts.
  - Disk/mount commands can fail if /proc or /sys is unavailable (should not happen in normal containers).

EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT:
- Runs inside rah-linux container.
- Working directory behavior:
  - Does not change directory.
  - Uses whatever current working directory the runner has.
- File system assumptions:
  - /proc is available for lscpu/free/mount context.
  - /work exists (but may be empty).
  - /rah/tools may exist as a mount.

OUTPUT:
- stdout behavior:
  - Combined output of:
    - uname -a
    - lscpu (first 120 lines)
    - free -h
    - df -h
    - mount (first 200 lines)
  - Output is plain text, multi-section, in that order.
- stderr behavior:
  - If any command errors, it may emit stderr.
  - Expect stderr if a command is missing or access is restricted.
- exit codes and meanings:
  - 0: All commands succeeded.
  - Non-zero: One of the commands failed and caused the overall command chain to fail.

SIDE EFFECTS:
- Files created/modified:
  - None.
- Network access:
  - None.
- Installed packages:
  - None.
- State changes:
  - None.

SAFETY RULES:
- MUST verify:
  - Nothing. This tool is safe and read-only.
- MUST NEVER guess:
  - Do not infer host OS/hardware from this output; it is container context.
  - Do not infer availability of Docker daemon from mount output alone.
- Requires user confirmation:
  - None. Read-only diagnostics.

COMMON FAILURE MODES:
- lscpu not present in minimal images (rare).
- free not present in minimal images (rare).
- mount output truncated (it is intentionally limited to 200 lines).
- df -h may not show host disks; only container-visible mounts.

EXAMPLES:
1) sys.info
2) sys.info 
3) sys.info   
4) sys.info ignored_extra_text
5) sys.info anything_here_is_ignored

ANTI-HALLUCINATION NOTES:
- Do NOT invent fields that are not printed.
- Do NOT assume /work is mounted just because the tool exists.
- Do NOT claim RAM/disk totals beyond what is shown.
- If output is truncated, say it is truncated and use a more specific tool (sys.mount.check, repo.ls, etc.) instead.
- Do NOT reinterpret CPU flags; report them as shown.
- Do NOT claim this reveals host machine hardware; it reveals the container’s view.
- Do NOT fabricate “GPU” info; this tool does not query GPUs.
- Do NOT pretend it reports container runtime (Docker vs Podman); it does not.
- If something is missing, state “not present in output” rather than guessing.
- If an error appears, keep the exact error text; do not paraphrase into invented causes.
- If you need more detail (e.g., mount writability), call the correct tool instead.
- Never append new commands; this tool is fixed by the manifest.
- Never modify the intended order of sections when describing output.
- Treat this output as a snapshot, not a guarantee of future state.
- If asked for “exact disk free in /work”, use df -h section, not assumptions.
- If /proc is unavailable, do not guess; report failure and stop.
