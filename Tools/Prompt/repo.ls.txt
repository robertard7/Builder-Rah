C:\dev\rah\RahOllamaOnly\Tools\Prompt\repo.ls.txt
TOOL ID:
repo.ls

CATEGORY:
repo

PURPOSE:
List the current working directory contents and the /work directory contents.
Prints `pwd`, `ls -la .`, then `ls -la /work`.

WHEN TO USE:
- You need to see where the tool is currently running (pwd).
- You want a quick view of files in the current directory.
- You want to confirm what exists under /work in the container.
- You are orienting before running file operations.
- You suspect the working directory is wrong and need evidence.

WHEN NOT TO USE:
- You need a recursive tree; use repo.tree instead.
- You need to find a file by name pattern; use file.find instead.
- You need detailed file metadata beyond ls; use file.stat for specific paths.
- You want to list a different directory than current and /work; this tool is fixed.
- You are dealing with extremely large /work and only want a subset; this tool prints full ls output (still manageable).

INPUT PARAMETERS:
- {args} parsing:
  - This tool ignores {args}; it has no parameters in the manifest.
  - Any provided args are not used by the command template.
- Positional arguments:
  - None.
- Optional arguments:
  - None.
- Defaults:
  - Always lists `.` and `/work`.
- Error conditions:
  - If /work does not exist: ls will error.
  - If permissions block listing: ls errors.
  - If pwd fails (rare): shell error.

EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT:
- Runs inside rah-linux container.
- Working directory behavior:
  - Uses whatever current directory the runner has set.
  - Does not cd.
- File system assumptions:
  - /work is expected to exist and contain the workspace.
  - Current directory may or may not be /work depending on tool runner.

OUTPUT:
- stdout behavior:
  - Prints the current directory path (pwd).
  - Prints `ls -la .` output.
  - Prints separator line `-----`.
  - Prints `ls -la /work` output.
- stderr behavior:
  - Errors from ls if directories missing or permission denied.
- exit codes and meanings:
  - 0: command completed successfully.
  - Non-zero: errors listing directories (missing mounts or permissions).

SIDE EFFECTS:
- Files created/modified:
  - None.
- Network access:
  - None.
- Installed packages:
  - None.
- State changes:
  - None.

SAFETY RULES:
- MUST verify before calling:
  - Nothing sensitive is expected to be printed; repo.ls is safe but may show filenames.
- MUST NEVER be guessed:
  - Do not claim files exist unless they appear in output.
  - Do not assume current dir is /work; read pwd output.
- Requires user confirmation:
  - None typically, because listing is read-only.
  - If user has privacy concerns about filenames, confirm.

COMMON FAILURE MODES:
- /work not mounted.
- Permission denied on /work.
- Runner starts in unexpected directory.
- Extremely large directory listing can be long (but still bounded).

EXAMPLES:
1) repo.ls
2) repo.ls ""
3) repo.ls (no args)
4) repo.ls (ignored args are still ignored)
5) repo.ls (used to confirm /work content)

ANTI-HALLUCINATION NOTES:
- Do NOT infer repository structure beyond what is listed.
- Do NOT invent missing files or directories.
- Do NOT claim git repo exists; this tool does not check .git.
- Do NOT claim /work is writable; this tool does not test writing.
- Do NOT convert paths to Windows.
- Do NOT assume /work contains the intended project; verify names.
- Do NOT reference tools not yet written here.
- If stderr shows missing /work, treat that as environment issue, not “probably fine”.
- Keep conclusions tied to the listing shown.
- Do not summarize hidden files unless output shows them.
- Do not interpret file sizes as “big” or “small” without context.
- Never fabricate timestamps or permissions.
- Treat output as authoritative.
