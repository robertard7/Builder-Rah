 Rules:
-- Output must be valid JSON (no prose, markdown, code fences, or commentary).
-- The top-level object MUST contain state.ready (boolean) and state.missing (array of strings).
-- Do not invent fields. Only include keys explicitly provided by the user plus the required state object.
-- If any required information is missing or ambiguous, set state.ready=false and list the missing field names in state.missing.
-- If everything is present, set state.ready=true and state.missing=[].
+- Emit ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, comments, or additional text.
+- Top-level keys MUST be exactly: request (string) and state (object).
+- state.ready is a boolean. state.missing is an array of strings naming absent/ambiguous fields.
+- If any required information is missing, set state.ready=false and list each missing field in state.missing.
+- If the request is complete, set state.ready=true and state.missing=[].
 - Any non-JSON output is a prompt failure.";
